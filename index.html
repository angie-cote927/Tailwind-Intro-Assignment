<!-- What is Tailwind CSS? Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that has pre-made CSS classes that pertain to CSS attributes, all applicable in just your HTML file. -->

<!-- How is it different from traditional CSS or Bootstrap? The difference between Tailwind and Bootstrap is that Tailwind uses single purpose classes that help style elements efficiently, while Bootstrap pre-built elements, like buttons and cards, making it faster, but also less flexible design wise. Tailwind is different from CSS because it takes up much fewer lines, and makes your file system much more concise, not needing any CSS files at all in order to do all of your styling, you can do it all in document with the classes. -->

<!-- What are utility classes? Utility classes are the pre-defined classes that Tailwind uses in order to help you efficiently style your websites. They help in order to have design consistency across the entire site since they are pre-defined, they allow you to do things such as hover and such in your HTML document, which you cannot do with inline styling, and it allows you to use media queries, which are also not possible with inline styling. You can do all of this without even having to make a CSS file. -->
